# Lighthouse Keeper

A Sims-style lighthouse game for Ralph and Eddie: tell the keeper what to do by typing or tapping objects, then keep him happy through the day. The playable cutaway currently has a kitchen, living room, bedroom with en suite, and lamp room.

## Run it
```
npm install
npm run dev      # Next.js 14; open http://localhost:3000 (or this computer’s address on the same wifi, for the iPad)
npm test         # 114 tests
npm run upgrades # copy data/upgrades.csv (the upgrade list) into the game
npm run build    # production build
npm run sprites  # snap Codex's PNGs in art/raw/ into public/sprites/ (docs/CODEX_ASSETS.md)
```
On an iPad: open the address in Safari, Share, Add to Home Screen for full screen.

## Current implementation

- Floors 1–3 are modular fixed-width components in `src/ui/floors.tsx`: kitchen, living room, and bedroom with en suite. The first production Pixel batch now supplies the red/white shell bands and those three 105 × 35 room plates; interactive furniture remains separate. The toilet and wash basin are both in the en suite.
- Future standard floors are intentionally non-linear: kitchen anchors the base, lamp room stays topmost, bedroom stays directly below it, and each other floor receives a one-time random saved middle position. Concept-art taper is decorative and never fixes room width or unlock order.
- Missions run side by side, so floors arrive in any order; a finished floor appears the next morning in a random middle place that the save keeps (kitchen at the bottom, bedroom under the lamp room).
- Every object renderer accepts `standard`, `on`, and `broken`; active gameplay drives `on`. Broken objects share integer-step casing wobble, smoke and sparks. Add `?broken=tv,cooker` (or `?broken=all`) to the URL for the internal art-state preview.
- Objects can be upgraded with credits from their tap menu. The tier list is `data/upgrades.csv`. Higher tiers do more good, faster; the bed's tier sets the morning's energy. Grown-ups set upgrade prices (overall %, then per tier) and can gift upgrades. Tier sprites are `obj_<id>_t<n>_<state>`; until they exist a `T<n>` tag stands in. `?tiers=3` previews top tiers.
- Keeper-owned assets can now break during play, block their normal actions, and be repaired. Grown-ups control average fault frequency and maximum concurrent faults; defaults are off / one. Breakdown events expose placeholder SFX categories for later audio. The shop is excluded because it is not the keeper's asset.
- The production keeper batch now supplies 158 aligned exports: front/back master parts plus domestic movement, sad/hungry/bored/cross reactions, rear toilet sickness, a connected bathrobe walk/shower-door/entry sequence, fish-tank care, reading/writing, workbench and craft actions, cake and plated-meal carrying/placement, games, exercise, bathing/showering, fishing, watering, travel, six three-view costume families, and the previously delivered adventure, garden, boat, music, cinema, bedtime, swim and weather sets. Mirror/reverse metadata avoids redundant directions. The keeper is the authoritative scale for all props through `data/keeper_asset_contract.json`; interaction, movement, seating, instrument, ground, oven, table, toilet, shower, fish-tank, bed and sightline points are fixed there. Descriptive aliases reuse switch motion for instrument checks and piano hand motion for computer typing. Cooker and basin jobs select their rear-facing strips; most newer clips remain unwired until their world mechanics exist.
- Sprite manifest entries may be old string paths or metadata objects with frames, fps and optional loop/mirror/reverse/interaction-point contracts. Horizontal strips animate without CSS scaling or rotation.
- All SVG object targets work by touch, mouse, Enter and Space. At a 1024 × 768 iPad viewport, the first-three-floor targets were verified at a minimum 82 × 94 CSS px.

## Where things are

- `src/game/` — rules (`config.ts` has every number, `commands.ts` the command book and silly reactions, `engine.ts` the rules).
- `src/ui/floors.tsx` — fixed-width room definitions and the reserved diving geometry, which follows the bedroom.
- `src/ui/art.tsx` and `src/ui/Sprite.tsx` — vector fallbacks, the three-state renderer, and production strip playback.
- `public/sprites/` — production room, TV/effect and keeper review PNGs plus their runtime manifest.
- `art/source/keeper-first-batch/` — the generated keeper turnaround, deterministic density-4 authoring script, contact sheet and provenance notes.
- `art/source/first-production-batch/` — untouched generated sources and prompt/provenance notes; `scripts/build_first_asset_batch.py` rebuilds the exact `art/raw/` deliveries, then `npm run sprites` publishes them.
- `docs/PRODUCTION_ASSET_KIT.md` — exact Pixel filenames, dimensions, anchors, pivots, z-order, frame counts, fps, and delivery order.
- `docs/KEEPER_ANIMATIONS.md` — plain-English animation index, direction rules and object-alignment instructions.
- `docs/KEEPER_ASSET_SCALE.md` — human-readable keeper measurements and the rules for sizing/placing objects.
- `data/keeper_asset_contract.json` — authoritative machine-readable scale, pivots and interaction points.
- `docs/EXPANSION_DESIGN.md` — living write-up of agreed room ideas, random floor placement, night reveals, weather, transport, island expansions and energy systems.
- `art/manifest.json` and `art/asset_inventory.json` — facts about the concept/prototype image pack; these are not a production rig.

## Stack
Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript, Vitest. Neon Postgres (optional; falls back to browser localStorage). Deploy on Vercel; set `DATABASE_URL` (pooled) for Production.

## Players and the database
A "Who is playing?" screen lets each child have their own game and their own grown-ups' dials (allowance, prices, quiz difficulty). With `DATABASE_URL` set (Neon via Vercel's Storage tab) saves live in Postgres and follow the player to any device; the tables are created automatically on first use. With no `DATABASE_URL` everything stays in the browser. Grown-ups' PIN starts as 1234 (Menu, then Grown-ups), and is checked on the server when the database is on.

## Verification

Last verified on 9 October 2026:

```sh
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The current verification commands above cover the game and sprite pipeline. The published main version remains unchanged while the TV/style-guide and keeper assets are under review in this project folder.
