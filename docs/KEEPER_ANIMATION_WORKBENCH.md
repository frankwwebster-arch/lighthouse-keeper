# Keeper Animation Workbench

Last updated: 12 October 2026.

## Current state

The separate workbench is deployed at `/animation-workbench`. **Final contains
zero animations and Draft contains zero active animation proposals.** Frank
reset both lanes after live playback showed that the coarse Frame 6 raster
created visible pixel-density, width, height, face and perspective changes at
route joins. Earlier V1/V2 turn and core-transition assets remain hash-pinned,
addressable provenance; they are not Final and must not seed new animation.

The only active visual proposal is the separate
`art/drafts/keeper-prime-master-2026-10-12-v1/` foundation pack, reviewed at
`/keeper-review/keeper-prime-master-v1/`. Animation redrafting begins only
after Frank explicitly approves that master.

## Prime Keeper authority

The exact right-turn Frame 6 originally established the Keeper's identity,
front stance, head position and endpoint intent. Its coarse 128 × 160 raster is
no longer a rendering target. Frank selected the first smooth generated render
as the proposed Prime Keeper base and replaced the legacy double pale stripe
with one broad pale chest-and-sleeve band because the simpler uniform is more
likely to remain coherent through turns and action poses.

Prime Master V1 is normalized into a 256 × 320 source cell representing the
same 32 × 40 logical cell at density 8, with anchor `[16, 40]`. It retains the
adult rectangular eyes, separate moustache, straight closed mouth, established
beard mass and slightly fuller body. The V11 artist-smock neutral remains a
rendering-quality comparison only. All double-stripe generations are rejected
provenance.

## Purpose and boundary

The workbench is the assembly and transition layer for the future redrawn set.
It is deliberately separate from `/keeper-review/` and does not share that
platform's decisions, queue, locks or browser state.

- Final is repository-backed and immutable in the browser.
- Draft recipes edit frame references, never source PNG bytes.
- Every animation must be judged through a complete route, not an isolated
  strip.
- A hidden door may conceal a costume change, but does not exempt the visible
  animation from its transition contract.
- Workbench approval does not promote raw or runtime sprites.

## Required transition contract

Every eventual action must provide:

1. `walk` — the engine extends only this stage from world placement;
2. `stop` — visible deceleration with continuing root motion;
3. optional `turn` — to exact front or exact back where the action requires it;
4. `action` — begins from the registered stop or turn endpoint;
5. recovery to the exact stop;
6. `walk-start` — acceleration without walking on the spot;
7. `walk` — translated departure.

The first walk cycle begins while the Keeper is fully hidden behind the
departure door, so the first visible pose is already mid-stride. Costume
transitions may be hidden behind doors. Standard-uniform pose, scale, floor
anchor, head position and rendering density must remain continuous at every
visible join.

## Editor framework

The implemented Draft/Final architecture remains ready for the new set:

- copy, remove and reorder frame references;
- loop an entire preview;
- repeat a selected contiguous frame section 2–12 times;
- scrub, step, play, pause and restart animation and route previews;
- export/import browser Draft JSON;
- display pose/outfit metadata warnings at joins.

Timeline entries use stable IDs and `timelineSegmentId` identifies the one
route segment controlled by an editable timeline. Overlapping section loops
fail closed. Browser storage is now namespaced as
`keeper-animation-workbench:v3`, so rejected V1/V2 working state is not loaded
into the reset library; its older local-storage key remains untouched and can
still be recovered manually.

## Source layout

- `data/keeper_animation_workbench.json` — authoritative catalogue;
- `public/keeper-animation-workbench/catalog.json` — byte-identical deployed
  catalogue;
- `src/animation-workbench/model.ts` — timeline, loop and transition compiler;
- `src/animation-workbench/AnimationWorkbench.tsx` — review UI;
- `scripts/build_keeper_animation_workbench.py` — deterministic catalogue and
  historical-asset publisher;
- `scripts/verify_keeper_animation_workbench.ts` — lane, provenance, geometry,
  gutter and framework verifier;
- `scripts/build_keeper_prime_master_v1.py` and
  `scripts/verify_keeper_prime_master_v1.ts` — new smooth foundation pack.

Historical V1/V2 public assets remain content-addressed so provenance and old
exported recipes are recoverable. Presence in the asset table is not approval
and does not place an item in either active lane.

## Rebuild and verification

```sh
/Users/frank/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/python/bin/python3 scripts/build_keeper_prime_master_v1.py
/Users/frank/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/python/bin/python3 scripts/build_keeper_animation_workbench.py
npm run verify:keeper-prime-master-v1
npm run verify:keeper-animation-workbench
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The checks pin the two selected references, generated source, rejected variants,
normalized candidate, sidecar, masks/guides and comparison evidence; require a
transparent cell-edge gutter; require data/public catalogue identity; require
zero active Final and Draft items; preserve the editor feature contract; and
confirm raw/runtime art and the runtime manifest remain unchanged.

## Next approval gate

Frank must approve Prime Master V1 before any animation is redrafted. After
approval, restart at the core set in small reviewable batches: walk and exact
stop, stop-to-walk, side-to-front/back turns, then sit/stand. Every frame in a
batch must be authored from the same smooth high-resolution family. Only after
the core joins are accepted should action and costume inventories follow.

## Known limitations

- The workbench currently assembles recipes; it does not draw or rewrite PNGs.
- Browser Drafts are local unless exported.
- The UI does not yet add/remove route segments.
- Visual seam judgement still happens in playback; the future redraw builder
  must add deterministic pixel, anchor, silhouette and unchanged-region checks
  per join.
