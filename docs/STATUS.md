# Lighthouse Keeper: status write-up (10 Oct 2026)

## What it is
A Sims-style web game for Ralph (7) and Eddie (11). A keeper lives in a lighthouse; kids type commands (typo-tolerant, curated, no live AI) or click objects (Sims-style menus, auto-zoom camera). Needs and mood, credits, phone, bedtime, multi-day play, a day report, quiz pop-ins, time-aware chat, cheeky humour.

## Where it lives
- Code: github.com/frankwwebster-arch/lighthouse-keeper (branch `main`).
- Live: **https://lighthouse-keeper-mu.vercel.app** (the one address to use and bookmark).
- Vercel project `lighthouse-keeper` (team frankwwebster-4308s-projects). Every push to `main` deploys to production.
- The long addresses like `lighthouse-keeper-di4axnjgx-...vercel.app` are one-off links for a single deploy. Ignore them; they are also login-protected.
- Database: Neon Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` (verified: `/api/players` answers `db:true`). Tables are created on first use: players, saves, player_rules, settings (PIN hash).

## Built
Engine (seeded, deterministic, 122 tests), SVG cutaway scene with zoom camera, typo matcher, quizzes levels 1-3, credit economy with admin dials (allowance from per-need green bars, prices, gifting, quiz level and breakdown pressure per player), who-is-playing screen, per-player saves (DB or localStorage), grown-ups PIN (starts 1234; change it).

The first three playable floors are now modular fixed-width components: kitchen, living room, and bedroom with en suite. Objects have a runtime `standard` / `on` / `broken` contract, state-specific strip support, shared broken effects, keyboard/touch hit areas, and rear-facing cooker/basin keeper fallbacks. Random keeper-owned breakdowns are off by default and controlled by grown-ups' frequency and maximum-concurrent dials; broken assets block normal use until repaired. Floor 3 reserves an invisible two-door changing zone for the later diving-board extension.

Missions (`src/game/missions.ts`, list in `config.ts`) are all open at once and count in parallel, so floors arrive in any order: Fishy Business → aquarium, Storm Chaser → weather station, Strange Rumblings (a mystery until he makes a start) → hidden lair underground, and Puffed Out → lift (opens once the tower has 5 floors). Goals count things he already does (fishing, nature channel, telescope, ships kept safe, digging, visitors, quiz answers, good days). A finished mission pays credits (10 by default) at once; its floor is built overnight and appears the next morning, furnished (one new floor a morning; the lift goes in at once). Each new floor takes a random middle place, saved for good: kitchen always at the bottom, bedroom always directly under the lamp room, lair below ground. The view zooms out to fit; the lift makes stairs quicker. 🎯 Mission button shows progress; grown-ups set an overall mission size (% of normal) and reward, then can override any single goal or reward, and can finish any open mission. Typing about a floor he has not got gets a hint. `?floors=all` previews every floor. New floors and furniture are stand-ins until Codex's art (hooks in docs/FOR_CODEX.md).

Upgrades: almost every object has Basic, Middle and Top tiers, listed in `data/upgrades.csv` (Frank's tracker page and Codex both work from it; `npm run upgrades` copies it into the game, and a test fails if the copy is stale). He buys the next tier from the object's tap menu with credits; a new one replaces a broken one. Each tier makes that object's jobs do more good (+25% / +50%) and take less time (−15% / −30%); the bed's tier sets the morning's energy (80 / 90 / 100%). Grown-ups set one price % for all upgrades, can override any single tier's price, and can give any next tier as a present. Tier art is a stand-in (`T2`/`T3` tag) until Codex's `obj_<id>_t<n>_<state>` sprites arrive; `?tiers=3` previews them.

The living-room nap now belongs to an upgradeable passive armchair: basic
armchair → rocking chair → Lazyboy-style recliner. All tiers retain the same
11 px seat contact, and passive furniture is excluded from breakdowns.

The recipe studio now consumes a checked keeper pose contract. The reviewed
191-sheet keeper source batch is unchanged as the visual-history denominator;
60 exact neutral stills and reusable bridge derivatives bring the working raw
inventory to 310 keeper sheets. Standard sample flows and the TV seated turn
have exact neutral joins, approved outfit walks have neutral-ended cycle/start/
stop derivatives, and every full-body sidecar has registered pose metadata.
The remaining 300 legacy endpoint repairs are measured from real RGBA pixels
and ordered in `docs/KEEPER_NEUTRAL_ENDPOINT_AUDIT.md`. `npm test` rejects new
or regressed endpoint failures against that frozen migration boundary.

**Still to do on floors:** the dawn reveal animation (Codex; the `unlocked` happening after `dawn` is the hook), furniture migration and the walking-distance bathroom rule from `docs/EXPANSION_DESIGN.md`. The diving extension now follows the bedroom's height but is not playable yet.

## Not built yet (agreed design)

Keeper review cards now also preview, save and export a proposed per-clip
runtime FPS. Accepted `animationFps` values belong in each animation's source
JSON sidecar and generated runtime manifest, not in the PNG sprite pixels.

1. Continue the neutral-endpoint repair queue in `docs/KEEPER_NEUTRAL_ENDPOINT_AUDIT.md`: standard outfit first, then one outfit at a time in `docs/KEEPER_COSTUME_ROUTE_AUDIT.md` order. The five studio samples are the early visual gate; the specialised hot-drink prop-state bridges are their remaining seam work. In parallel, Frank's imported visual review remains 88 of 173 animations Happy, 70 Awaiting new draft review, 3 Review later and 12 Unreviewed. Frank's saved per-animation width and height remain final production art direction.
2. Art for the mission floors (aquarium, weather station, hidden lair), their furniture, the lift and a floor-arrival effect (Codex; hooks in docs/FOR_CODEX.md).
3. Tier art for upgrades (Codex; list in docs/FOR_CODEX.md). Typed commands for upgrading ("upgrade the TV") are not in yet; upgrades are bought from the tap menu.
4. Mini games: fishing, cooking, telescope spotting.
5. Day/night palette, non-skippable ~30s night recap.
6. Replace the temporary on-island shop fallback with an early off-island unlock and boat travel through an indoor water-filled boathouse/dry dock. Boat tiers: rowing boat, tug, speedboat. The external shop never breaks; the keeper's boathouse, jetty and boat may.
7. Workshop floor that reduces breakdown pressure; tune its effect only after Ralph's playtesting shows whether faults are fun or irritating.

## Housekeeping for Frank
- Change the grown-ups PIN from 1234.
- Add Ralph and Eddie on the Who is playing screen (none exist yet).

## Verification and delivery

Keeper neutral-contract commit `e74b93b` passed all 149 project tests, TypeScript checking, the production build, sprite export, the 310-sheet runtime catalogue verification and the historical 191-sheet / 1,420-frame identity audit. It is on remote `main`; the canonical Vercel home and `/studio` routes both returned HTTP 200 on 10 October 2026, with `/studio` serving the same built chunk as the verified local production build.
